    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>2½ pounds chicken wing sections</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Honey Siracha Glaze</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
      <li>⅓ cup sriracha sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch sesame seeds, or as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with aluminum foil and place an oven-proof wire rack over the foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk baking powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika together in a small
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the baking powder
        mixture over wings and toss to coat. Repeat with remaining baking powder
        mixture, tossing well to coat. Arrange wings on the rack of the prepared
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn wings and continue
        baking for 20 minutes. Turn wings again and bake until wings are browned
        and crispy, about 15 minutes more. Transfer wings to a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the glaze: Whisk honey, sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil
        together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle glaze over wings and toss to
        coat completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer wings to a serving platter and sprinkle sesame seeds over the
        top.
